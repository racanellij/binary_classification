Visualization and Analysis of Credit Card Fraud Data

This project aims to visualize and create a predictive model which is able to correctly classify credit card transaction data as either fraudulent or legitimate. I include a file with a few functions that I use to create visualizations of our data, as well as a jupyter notebook file which explains my analysis.

Prerequisites

It would be helpful for you to know a bit about machine learning concepts and best practices. Knowledge of the risks associated with overfitting models, monitoring model statistics, neural networks, and machine learning best practices will be helpful but are not necessary. 

You don't need any software to view the analysis.
