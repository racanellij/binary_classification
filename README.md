Visualization and Analysis of Credit Card Fraud Data

This project aims to visualize and create a predictive model which is able to correctly classify credit card transaction data as either fraudulent or legitimate. I include a file with a few functions that I use to create visualizations of our data, as well as a jupyter notebook file which explains my analysis.

With only 2 days of transaction data (around 300k observations), I was able to construct a model that was over 97% accurate and was able to recall 92% of the fraudulent transactions on testing data. With so little data I was able to arrive at a very effective neural network. Similar methods could be used with larger datasets that would likely generate models that would quickly start to approach perfect accuracy and recall. 

Prerequisites

It would be helpful for you to know a bit about machine learning concepts and best practices. Knowledge of the risks associated with overfitting models, monitoring model statistics, and neural networks would be helpful but are not necessary.

You don't need any software to view the analysis.
